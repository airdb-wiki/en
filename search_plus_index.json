Well, it all depends on how you watch them. If you’re just watching the Chinese subtitles Thinking your English would improve that way. Then you’d be dreaming Because you’re not really listening It’s like right now I’m speaking English But are you really listening to the words that I am saying. I bet you are just staring at the Chinese subtitles. We’re so used to it. If you really wanna improve your listening Then you have to turn off the Chinese subtitles. And if you’re an advanced learner Then turn off the English subtitles too. You really need to step out of your comfort zone And what you need to understand is not just what they’re saying. But why they’re saying it. Which requires a better understanding of their culture as a whole And for that, I recommend this APP. It offers comprehensive access to English learning. You can learn it through movies, TW shows, radios, news, you name it. What are you waiting for ? Go get it.
