For Humans to live, we need clean air and clean water. Pollution is now a growing problem around the world. Pollution poisons the air and water that we depend on. Polluted air makes people sick and afraid to go outside. Polluted water poisons our food supply. As a result, we never know which foods are safe to eat. Human beings cannot live in a poisoned environment. Therefore, pollution is a major threat to our existence. Q: what is a growing problem? Q: what poisons the air and water? Segment 2 Humans need temperatures to be in a comfortable range. To be in a comfortable range means to be neither too hot nor too cold. With global warming, global temperatures are rising. As temperatures rise, the polar icecaps will melt. As the polar icecaps melt, ocean levels will rise. Areas of some coutries will soon be under water. People will be forced to relocate from flooded areas. Q: With global warming, what is rising? Q: As the polar icecaps melt, what will happen? Segment 3 In nature, even small changes can sometimes have large effects. It's difficult to predict what's going to happen. The entire ecosystem that we depend on is changing. Some of these changes are irreversible. Irreversible changes cannot be undone. Segment 4 Let's hope that humans are smart enough to understand how the world is changing. With more understanding, we can make better choices about what to do. We can face the challenges of pollution and global warming. We need to do this before it's too late.

Well, it all depends on how you watch them. If you’re just watching the Chinese subtitles Thinking your English would improve that way. Then you’d be dreaming Because you’re not really listening It’s like right now I’m speaking English But are you really listening to the words that I am saying. I bet you are just staring at the Chinese subtitles. We’re so used to it. If you really wanna improve your listening Then you have to turn off the Chinese subtitles. And if you’re an advanced learner Then turn off the English subtitles too. You really need to step out of your comfort zone And what you need to understand is not just what they’re saying. But why they’re saying it. Which requires a better understanding of their culture as a whole And for that, I recommend this APP. It offers comprehensive access to English learning. You can learn it through movies, TW shows, radios, news, you name it. What are you waiting for ? Go get it.

What I mean by that is that I believe that life happens in three phases. In the first phase, your life you're dependent on others and you're learning, you're a student. In the second phase of your life you're working. Other people are dependent on you, and you're trying to be successful. When you get late in that stage in your life, the thing you want more than anything else is to help others to be successful without you. And that's the stage I am in my life no longer do I want to be any more successful, But I want to pass that along. And if I pass that along well, then I go to the third stage. And I'm free and everybody's good. It's like many of you probably your parents what do they waht. They want you to be successful without them, right? And so that's the stage that's why I put out priciples that I'd like to share. So I'm going to take you through my life and work principles. There are many principles in the book, There are hundreds of principles in the book. I want to try to convey my most important ones in a simple way to me. This was what life is like, and I think it's probably what life is like for you. You go after your audacious goals, and the along the way on those audacious goals. You encounter your successes and you failures. You're going fail, failure is an important part of that learning process. And how you deal with failure is really important. If you embrace failure not embarrassed about what life is like, and I think it's probably what life is like for you. You go after your audacious goals, and the along the way on those audacious goals. You encounter your successes and you failures. You're going fail, failure is an important part of that learning process. And how you deal with failure is really important. If you embrace failure not embarrassed about it, Then you will learn and you will learn principles, you known, and I'm also an entrepreneur, and as an invertor one has to be an independent thinker. Because one has to bet against the consensus and be right. That's because the consensus view is wbuilt into the price. So only if you bet against the consensus, and a right are you gonna make a profit in the markets. And when you ever you're betting against the consensus you're going to be wrong a fair amount of times. And as an entrepreneur, it's the same thing you have to be an independent thinker, and bet against the consensus, and you're going to encounter failures. We don't highlight those failures, but that's part of the process and from that, you have to learn priciples. So, the thing that I began to learn is that my attitude about failing began to change. I began to look at failures like puzzles that would give me gems. If I cloud solve the puzzle, and the puzzle was what would I do differently in the future. So I wouldn't have that failure and the gem was a priciple that would help me. And I would write down that priciple, So learning principles learning and changing is an important part, then you improve, and then you go on to your more audacious goals and that is the process over and over again. I believe that's the evolutionary process. If you think about it, you cloud about products. It's the same for products. It's the same for nature. If you think of a product blackberry. Write a new goal a new innovation, But with time there's going to be failure. So I've learned that an instinct that pain plus relection equals progress. The pain is signaling to me something that I need to learn and I need to reflect. And if I, if you develop that instinctual reaction pain plus relection equas progress. And you think about that you cloud. I think you can lear that instinctual reaction pain plus relection equas progress. And you think about that you cloud. I think you can learn.

So much for …collecting data (what’s you have just talked about) So that’s the background… Referring back As I mentioned before… As I said earlier, … Let’s go back to what we were discussing earlier.

OK, 1 so that's the background and the reason we developed the programme. Any questions? OK. So, 2 let's move on to the next point and take a closer look at the Traffic Support Centre itself. 3 As I said earlier, the TSC was set up in 2001 to help traffic flow more smoothly, and basically to make the lives of motorists easier. In this part of my presentation 4 I'd like to tell you about the centre's activities, how we work exactly and how motorists benefit from our services. So, 5 Let me give you a brief overview of the TSC's activities. Our main activities are to collect, analyse, and communicate traffic information. After collecting traffic data from a number of different sources, we analyse them and then we inform the media, the police, or other authorities, and - last but not least - the motorists.(...) This now leads us to 6 my next point . How doest the TSC collect data? Traffic-monitoring equipment has been installed across the main traffic routes, which help us gather real-time information on traffic speed and traffic flow. Additionally, we use vaiable traffic sensors and cameras. We also work together with other partners and authorities, for example the police, traffic officers, and the media. Let me show you a few examples of how this works. (...) 7 So much for collecting data. 8 Let's now turn to the nnext issue. How do we communicate infor mation to motorists? We do this in a number of ways: by using electronic road signs, the Internet and radio, and state-of-the-art telephone technology. (...) Let me now come back to 9 what I said earlier . The TSC want to make the lives of motorists easier. So, in what ways doest the motorist benefit? Well, ... First: through real-time information about the traffic situation. Second, through better advice about alternative routes. Third, through safer roads and less driver stress.
