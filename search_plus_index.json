For Humans to live, we need clean air and clean water. Pollution is now a growing problem around the world. Pollution poisons the air and water that we depend on. Polluted air makes people sick and afraid to go outside. Polluted water poisons our food supply. As a result, we never know which foods are safe to eat. Human beings cannot live in a poisoned environment. Therefore, pollution is a major threat to our existence. Q: what is a growing problem? Q: what poisons the air and water? Segment 2 Humans need temperatures to be in a comfortable range. To be in a comfortable range means to be neither too hot nor too cold. With global warming, global temperatures are rising. As temperatures rise, the polar icecaps will melt. As the polar icecaps melt, ocean levels will rise. Areas of some coutries will soon be under water. People will be forced to relocate from flooded areas. Q: With global warming, what is rising? Q: As the polar icecaps melt, what will happen?

Well, it all depends on how you watch them. If you’re just watching the Chinese subtitles Thinking your English would improve that way. Then you’d be dreaming Because you’re not really listening It’s like right now I’m speaking English But are you really listening to the words that I am saying. I bet you are just staring at the Chinese subtitles. We’re so used to it. If you really wanna improve your listening Then you have to turn off the Chinese subtitles. And if you’re an advanced learner Then turn off the English subtitles too. You really need to step out of your comfort zone And what you need to understand is not just what they’re saying. But why they’re saying it. Which requires a better understanding of their culture as a whole And for that, I recommend this APP. It offers comprehensive access to English learning. You can learn it through movies, TW shows, radios, news, you name it. What are you waiting for ? Go get it.
