# Emotion

To love is to suffer, and to survive is to find the meaning of suffering.
- 爱就是受苦，生存就是找到受苦的意义。


If you fight for his love, fight for his attention, even his respect. Then the relationship is not healthy, you should consider and as well. You know, maybe you should really have a conversation with him
如果你为他的爱而战，为他的注意力而战，甚至他的尊重。 那么这种关系是不健康的，你应该考虑和为好。 你知道，也许你真的应该和他谈谈
