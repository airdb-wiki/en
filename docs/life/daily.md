Is watching movies or TW shows helpful for learning English?
Well, it all depends on how you watch them.

If you’re just watching the Chinese subtitles
Thinking your English would improve that way.

Then you’d be dreaming
Because you’re not really listening

It’s like right now I’m speaking English
But are you really listening to the words that I am saying.

I bet you are just staring at the Chinese subtitles.
We’re so used to it.

If you really wanna improve your listening

Then you have to turn off  the Chinese subtitles.

And if you’re an advanced learner
Then turn off the English subtitles too.



You really need to step out of your comfort zone

And what you need to understand is not just what they’re saying.
But why they’re saying it.

Which requires a better understanding of their culture as a whole
And for that, I recommend this APP.



It offers comprehensive access to English learning.
You can learn it through movies, TW shows, radios, news, you name it.

What are you waiting for ?  Go get it.
