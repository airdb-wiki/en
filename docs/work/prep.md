# PREP

## PREP technique for giving opinions

Example Question: Do you prefer morning or afternoon meetings?

P - Point: Give the main first clearly and concisely.

```text
eg.. I prefer morning meetings
```

R - Reason(s): State the primary reason right after main point.

```text
eg.. This is because I am more alert and productive in the morning.
```

E - Example: Give an example to clarify and support your reason.

```text
eg.. For example, before lunch I am hungry and can't concentrate, and after lunch I am sleepy and can't concertrate.
```

P - Point: Restate the point again, or introduce a new related point.

```text
eg.. So, I am much more productive in the morning, and can make a better contribution to meetings then.
```
