Dear Friends,

Today is my last day in xxx.com.

It's a wonderful and memorable 3+ year journey, where we grew and grind through it together.  

So would like to take this chance to say thank you to my mentors and colleagues

Definitely a big thank you to my team for all your help,support, understanding and patience where we have countless discussions on how to implement things we wanted efficiently with limited resources.

There are a lot more of you whom I cannot thank you personally 1 by 1, would like to take this chance to say thank you too, all the guidance and help you have provided throughout this journey is very appreciated, and also sorry for all the inconvenience caused too. Hope one day our path may cross again. Lets keep in contact guys and girls.

Today is the last working day in xxx.com. 

The past 2 years have been very fulfilling for me. I am very grateful for the opportunity to work and learn so much from everyone. 

I would like to apologize if I have said or done anything inappropriate throughout my time here in xx.com.

I would like to also take this opportunity to thank the family for the constant guidance and exposure given to me. As a fresh graduate with zero prior experience, I cannot overemphasize the importance of how the opportunity given to me to be part of the big family filled with so many masters meant so much to me. 

Additionally, I also want to specially mention and thank the following group of people:

To everyone else from xx.com, it was a great privilege working with all of you. I hope our paths may cross again in the future. 


Thanks everyone again, and all the best for the future endeavor.
