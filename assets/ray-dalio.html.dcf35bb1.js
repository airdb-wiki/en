that I&#39;m in in a transition in my life from the second phase of my life to the thrid phase of my life.</p><p>What I mean by that is that I believe that life happens in three phases.</p><p>In the first phase, your life you&#39;re dependent on others and you&#39;re learning, you&#39;re a student.</p><p>In the second phase of your life you&#39;re working.</p><p>Other people are dependent on you, and you&#39;re trying to be successful.</p><p>When you get late in that stage in your life,</p><p>the thing you want more than anything else is to help others to be successful without you.</p><p>And that&#39;s the stage I am in my life no longer do I want to be any more successful,</p><p>But I want to pass that along.</p><p>And if I pass that along well, then I go to the third stage.</p><p>And I&#39;m free and everybody&#39;s good.</p><p>It&#39;s like many of you probably your parents what do they waht.</p><p>They want you to be successful without them, right?</p><p>And so that&#39;s the stage that&#39;s why I put out priciples that I&#39;d like to share.</p><p>So I&#39;m going to take you through my life and work principles.</p><p>There are many principles in the book,</p><p>There are hundreds of principles in the book.</p><p>I want to try to convey my most important ones in a simple way to me.</p><p>This was what life is like, and I think it&#39;s probably what life is like for you.</p><p>You go after your audacious goals, and the along the way on those audacious goals.</p><p>You encounter your successes and you failures.</p><p>You&#39;re going fail, failure is an important part of that learning process.</p><p>And how you deal with failure is really important.</p><p>If you embrace failure not embarrassed about what life is like, and I think it&#39;s probably what life is like for you.</p><p>You go after your audacious goals, and the along the way on those audacious goals.</p><p>You encounter your successes and you failures.</p><p>You&#39;re going fail, failure is an important part of that learning process.</p><p>And how you deal with failure is really important.</p><p>If you embrace failure not embarrassed about it,</p><p>Then you will learn and you will learn principles, you known,</p><p>and I&#39;m also an entrepreneur, and as an invertor one has to be an independent thinker.</p><p>Because one has to bet against the consensus and be right.</p><p>That&#39;s because the consensus view is wbuilt into the price.</p><p>So only if you bet against the consensus, and a right are you gonna make a profit in the markets.</p><p>And when you ever you&#39;re betting against the consensus you&#39;re going to be wrong a fair amount of times.</p><p>And as an entrepreneur,</p><p>it&#39;s the same thing you have to be an independent thinker,</p><p>and bet against the consensus,</p><p>and you&#39;re going to encounter failures.</p><p>We don&#39;t highlight those failures,</p><p>but that&#39;s part of the process</p><p>and from that, you have to learn priciples.</p><p>So, the thing that I began to learn is that my attitude about failing began to change.</p><p>I began to look at failures like puzzles that would give me gems.</p><p>If I cloud solve the puzzle,</p><p>and the puzzle was what would I do differently in the future.</p><p>So I wouldn&#39;t have that failure and the gem was a priciple that would help me.</p><p>And I would write down that priciple,</p><p>So learning principles learning and changing is an important part,</p><p>then you improve,</p><p>and then you go on to your more audacious goals and that is the process over and over again.</p><p>I believe that&#39;s the evolutionary process.</p><p>If you think about it, you cloud about products.</p><p>It&#39;s the same for products.</p><p>It&#39;s the same for nature.</p><p>If you think of a product blackberry.</p><p>Write a new goal a new innovation,</p><p>But with time there&#39;s going to be failure.</p><p>So I&#39;ve learned that an instinct that pain plus relection equals progress.</p><p>The pain is signaling to me something that I need to learn and I need to reflect.</p><p>And if I, if you develop that instinctual reaction pain plus relection equas progress.</p><p>And you think about that you cloud.</p><p>I think you can lear that instinctual reaction pain plus relection equas progress.</p><p>And you think about that you cloud.</p><p>I think you can learn.</p>",66);function f(g,m){const a=n("ExternalLinkIcon");return p(),i("div",null,[h,l,e("p",null,[e("a",d,[c,s(a)])]),y])}var
