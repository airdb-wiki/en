But I actually didn&#39;t pay the full price for my rent.</p><p>I had a $1920 coupon from Airbnb.</p><p>So what happended was I booked a long-term stay on Airbnb, but the host cancelled on me last minute.</p><p>That really caused me a lot of hassle, so this was the compensation I received from Airbnb aside from my refund.</p><p>So for this apartment, I ended up only paying $1461.</p><p>Again, this is only because I had that coupon.</p><p>Divide that by 4, it comes down to $365 per week.</p><p>For transportation, you can pretty much get around just by subway. So I bought a monthly-unlimited metro card, which cost $127. That&#39;s $31.75 per week.</p><p>As for groceries, I just did grocery shopping the weekend before I started recording my expenses. I spent $44.79 at Trader Joe&#39;s. That usually lasts me a week-ish</p><p>Now, let&#39;s get into my daily spendings.</p><h2 id="monday" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#monday" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Monday</h2><p>I started off doing a live stream, and then I went and grabbed my favorite bagel. The bagel was $4.95 and it was pretty filling.</p><p>After that, I went and did laundry, I ended up spening $9 on laundry. Because I wanted to wash my sheets. So I had to choose the giger washers that cost $7.</p><p>Then I went to Times Square, My friend recommended me this secrect hotel bar that can oversee Timesquare. I got the corner seat all to myself. (\u72EC\u4EAB)</p><p>I ordered a Gin and Tonic, and the total came down to $18.</p><p>I ended up working for the rest of the night. And make some food at home</p><h2 id="tuesday" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#tuesday" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Tuesday</h2><p>I went to Greenwich village, I grabbed a coffee and a sandwich, and it cost me $18.</p><p>I mean... really? That&#39;s so expensive!</p><p>Then I got a hat that I absolutely adore. You can see me wearing it in almost all of my videos.</p><p>It was $72 but honestly, it was such an investment piece. I got so many compliments and it was kind of a conversation starter (\u804A\u5929\u5F00\u573A\u767D\uFF09.</p><p>I also got a necklace. At first, I wasn&#39;t proud of this purchase, &#39;cause I basically got it just to start a conversation with the store owner.</p><p>But a couple of weeks later, I grew to like it. I think it looks really good pairing with another chain, but anyways, the necklace was $15.</p><p>Another purchase that I&#39;m not so proud of is a bottle of whisky and it was $56. Whenever I travel, I always like to try some local small-batch whisky or beer.</p><p>My friend and I did finish it before I left, so I guess it was kind of worh it?</p><p>As for dinner, I just cooked at home, and did some work.</p><h2 id="wednesday" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#wednesday" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Wednesday</h2><p>was museum day, I woke up and made some food.</p><p>Then I headed to New Museum at SOHO. I spent the shole afternoon there. The ticket was $20. I think it was pretty standard.</p><p>In New York, some museums have pay-as-you-wish days which means you can pay whatever amount you like.</p><p>If you&#39;re trying to save money, that&#39;s the way to go.</p><p>For dinner, I got a slice of pizza. This place is called Prince Pizza, and it&#39;s pretty famous.</p><p>But $6 for slice of pizza...uhh...</p><p>I mean, pizza is just pizza, you know. Having just one slice of pizza, of course is not enough, so i heated up some leftovers(\u5269\u83DC\u5269\u996D) form the weekend before.</p><p>I totally forgot that I had curry left.</p><p>It&#39;s not that fresh but it cost me $0.</p><h2 id="thursday" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#thursday" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Thursday</h2><p>was an eventful day.</p><p>It&#39;s not that fresh but it cost me $0.</p><h2 id="thursday-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#thursday-1" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Thursday</h2><p>was an eventful day.</p><p>I filmed the video <code>How to go through customs in English</code>, then I made some food, I got the sort ribs from Trader Joe&#39;s. It was delicious.</p><p>I spent the afternoon editing, and right before sunset, I visited The Edge. It&#39;s an observatory(\u89C2\u666F\u53F0) that I&#39;d always wanted to go to. The ticket was $52.</p><p>It&#39;s definitely on the pricier side (\u7684\u786E\u6BD4\u8F83\u8D35)</p><p>But I&#39;d say if you&#39;re visiting New York, it&#39;s definitely worth seeing.</p><p>It makes you feel like you&#39;re on the top of the world, and everything is just under your feet.</p><p>For dinner, I got Shake Shack. This is something I&#39;ve been craving for a while. I&#39;m not a vegetarian, but the Shroom Burger was so delicious. Look at the cheese.</p><p>Also, I got the Brooklyn-brewed beer, &#39;cause um... it&#39;s local brewed...</p><p>and I am a sucker for locally brewed whatever.</p><p>And at night, I booked a ticket to a musical called &quot;The Office! A Music Parody&quot;.</p><p>It was my first time watching a musical In New York.</p><p>I didn&#39;t end up going to Broadway &#39;cause I am not that into musicals, but I am very, very into The Office.</p><p>It si my favorite show of all time, and the musical was basically, all the classic scenes adapted into music.</p><p>And I got all the references, so I was really pround of myself! The ticket was $63.</p><p>After the show ended, it was already 10:00 PM. So for safety reasons, I took a Uber back, it was $15.</p><p>I spent quite a lot on Thursday, but the experience was just incredible. I would totally do it again!</p><h2 id="friday" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#friday" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Friday</h2><p>was pretty much just a workday, I made some food at home for lunch.</p><p>For dinner, I went to this udon place that I&#39;ve heard good things about.</p><p>I had the chicken udon.</p><p>But honestly, it was just alright...</p><p>uhh, the total turned out to be $21</p><p>uh um, yeah.</p><p>I reserved a seat at comedy show last minute. It was a 1.5-hour show with 5 comics. I think I literally laughed to tears.</p><p>I&#39;ve always loved standup, and getting to see it live instead of on Youtube was so much fun.</p><p>But the comedy shows are expensive. It&#39;s a $25 cover, plus 2 items o the menu, plus tips.</p><p>In total, I think I paid almost $70 after tips.</p><p>That&#39;s way more than I expected &#39;cause I thought it was just a $25 cover.</p><p>But honestly, in hindsight(\u4E8B\u540E\u770B\u6765), I would totally do it again.</p><p>It was one of the greatest nights I had in New York.</p><h1 id="weekend" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#weekend" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Weekend</h1><p>Saturdays and Sundays are normally my workdays, I don&#39;t like leaving the house on the weekends, because it&#39;s usually really crowded outside.</p><p>On Saturday, I worked all day, and got Katsudon around the evening, &#39;cause I was craving for some warm rice and soup. That cost me $28.</p><p>On Sunday, I went to Brooklyn to shoot the mid-roll ad that you probably saw a couple of minutes ago.</p><p>And after the shoot, I got a chocolate chip cookie, and just sat there and watched the sunset.</p><p>I think the cookie was 4 dollars? I paid by cash so I don&#39;t really remember.</p><p>So for this whole week, I ended up spending $930.84</p><p>At the end of the day, New York is still very very expensive to live in.</p><p>I&#39;d say the living cost is at least 3-4 times higher than in Taipei.</p><p>I&#39;m glad that I was able to spend a month here, just to get the taste of it, instead of committing to a long-term lease or a job here...</p><p>Overall, the verdict is ... New York is fun to visit, but I really didn&#39;t see myself living here long term.</p><p>Unless the connections you make in the city help your career.</p><p>I don&#39;t see how anyone can justify the price.</p><p>Let me know in the comments below \`would you ever want to live in New York? And what&#39;s your strategy when you travel, do you spend more on food, experiences, or shopping?&quot;</p><p>Anyways, that&#39;s it for this video, and I&#39;ll see you in my next one!</p><p>Living cost:</p><div class="language-text ext-text line-numbers-mode"><pre class="shiki" style="background-color:#1E1E1E;"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#D4D4D4;">Airbnb
